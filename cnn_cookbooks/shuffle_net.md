* pointwise group convolution
* channel shuffle


Compared with popular structures like [27, 9, 37], for a given computation complexity budget, our ShuffleNet allows more feature map channels, which helps to encode more information and is especially critical to the performance of very small networks.

generalizes group convolution and depthwise separable convolution in a novel form.
