> Object localization by analyzing the change in the recognition scores when feeding into different regions of the image.

* **Self-Taught** Object Localization with Deep Networks  



### Attention models

* **Attention Correctness** in Neural Image Captioning  
    The proposed evauation metric:  
    Let $$R$$ be the groundtruth attention region, the attention correctness is $$AC=\sum_{i \in R} \alpha_{i}$$, which is a score between 0 and 1. $$\alpha_{i}$$ is resized and normalized in order to ensure size consistency. The baseline score is simply the percentage of the bounding box size over the size of the whole image. Draw histograms of attention correctness.
